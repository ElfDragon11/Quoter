# Quotewall - AI-Powered Wallpaper Generator

Quotewall is an Android application that empowers you to create unique and personalized phone wallpapers. Leveraging AI, Quotewall generates stunning background images based on your preferences and overlays them with your favorite quotes.

## Key Features:

*   **AI Background Generation**:
    *   Specify a **Location** (e.g., Mountains, Forest, Ocean, Space, City), **Scene** (e.g., Natural, Sunset, Futuristic, Modern), and **Style** (e.g., Photorealistic, Oil Painting, Cartoon) to guide the AI in creating a background image.
    *   Provide a **Quote** to be featured on the wallpaper.
    *   Choose a **Font Style** (e.g., Bold, Artistic, Cursive) and adjust the **Font Size** for the quote text.
    *   The app supports custom text input for all generation parameters if the predefined options don't meet your needs.
*   **Image Library**:
    *   All generated images are saved to a local library within the app.
